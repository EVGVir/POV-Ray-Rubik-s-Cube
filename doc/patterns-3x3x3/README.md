Rubik's Cube 3x3x3 Patterns
===========================

File [rubik-cube-patterns-3x3x3.inc](../../rubik-cube-patterns-3x3x3.inc)
contains movements which can be applied to a non-mixed cube to produce
some nice patterns. A lot of patterns are got from site
[ruwix.com](https://ruwix.com).

All patterns have common prefix `rubik_cube_patterns_3x3x3_`. The
suffix `exchanged` means that opposite sides exchanged by pieces. The
suffix `twisted` meanse that adjacent sides exchanged by pieces.

[The Superflip](superflip)
--------------------------
Every piece is where it's supposed to be but the edges are oriented
wrong. It is need the highest amount of steps (20) to solve this
state.
